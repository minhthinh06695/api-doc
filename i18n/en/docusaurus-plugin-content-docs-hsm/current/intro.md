# Fast HSM - Technical Integration

Welcome to **Fast HSM** - Fast's secure digital signature and data encryption solution.

## Introduction

Fast HSM provides powerful APIs for partners to integrate features:

- üîê **Digital Signature** - Sign documents and important data
- üõ°Ô∏è **Data Encryption** - Encrypt/decrypt according to JWE standard (AES)
- üìã **Certificate Management** - Get information and manage certificates
- üîë **Secure Authentication** - Token-based authentication system

## Fast HSM Integration Process

    participant Partner
    participant Application as HSM Service

    %% Step 1: Manual Registration
    Note over Partner,Application: Partner contacts provider to receive credentials (username, password).

    %% Step 2: Authentication and Get Access Token
    Note over Partner,Application: Authentication and Get Token
    Partner->>Application: POST /api/account/gettoken (username, password)
    activate Application
    Application->>Application: Verify information, generate token
    Application-->>Partner: 200 OK (Access Token)
    deactivate Application

    %% Step 3: Get Certificate Information
    Note over Partner,Application: Get Certificate Information
    Partner->>Application: POST /api/certificate/getinfosn (with Access Token)
    activate Application
    Application->>Application: Retrieve certificate information
    Application-->>Partner: 200 OK (Certificate Data)
    deactivate Application

    %% Step 4: Use HSM Services
    loop Using digital signature services
        alt Digital Signature
            Partner->>Application: POST /api/sign/signhash (data to sign, Token)
            activate Application
            Application->>Application: Perform hash signing
            Application-->>Partner: 200 OK (Signed Data)
            deactivate Application
        else Data Encryption
            Partner->>Application: POST /api/sign/encryptjwe (data to encrypt, Token)
            activate Application
            Application->>Application: Perform JWE encryption
            Application-->>Partner: 200 OK (Encrypted Data)
            deactivate Application
        else Data Decryption
            Partner->>Application: POST /api/sign/decryptjwe (data to decrypt, Token)
            activate Application
            Application->>Application: Perform JWE decryption
            Application-->>Partner: 200 OK (Decrypted Data)
            deactivate Application
        end
    end

    Note over Partner,Application: Integration successful! System ready to use all features.
